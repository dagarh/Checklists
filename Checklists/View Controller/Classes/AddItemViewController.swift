Now while using UIControl events, there are 2 ways. One is to create the action method for particular event from connection inspector by pressing ctrl and then drag. Another way is this which I did below i.e using "addTarget" method. Target could be nil, in that case event will look for its action method using the "Responder chain" hierarchy. If it does not find that action method then that event would be ignored by an iOS. */
